## MY FIRST REACT web APP

This is a basic react app made using simple react concepts like COMPONENTS , useState and useEffect.

An API has been used that gives the recipe for anything.

In this simple app, a query is taken using a searchBar and api is fetched using the query and, gives pic of the prepared food , calories and Ingredients for the recipe.

I had help from a youtube tutorial in making of this. Hoping to create the next one on my own (mostly).
